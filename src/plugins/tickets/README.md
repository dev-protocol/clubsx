Tickets are a fun way to create, manage and foster community activity!

This Tickets plugin turns memberships created by the Membership plugin into tickets.

Tickets are NFTs mapped to each membership, thus allowing users to purchase tickets as often as they need them and when they need them. When a user uses a ticket, the NFT with that ID is no longer in use, preventing unauthorized use.
