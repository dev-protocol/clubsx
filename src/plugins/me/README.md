Me plugin adds a userâ€™s personal page to your club.

The personal page has URL /me and the page content is changed by the user accessing it. This plugin is integrated with the wallet button in the Default theme, and the connected wallet button is automatically replaced with a link to the personal page.

The personal page allows users to view their memberships. More information may be added in the future.
